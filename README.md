 Features Implemented

1. Login System:
   - Redirects users to respective main menus based on roles:
     - `MemberMainMenu` for Members.
     - `AdminMainMenu` for Admins.
     - `SuperAdminMainMenu` for Super Admins.
   - Displays an error message if credentials are invalid.

2. Database:
   - Includes tables for `Members`, `Admin`, and `SuperAdmin`, with fields for `Username` and `Password`.
   - Test data added for testing purposes:
     - Admin: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
     - Member: Username: `abel`, Password: `abel`
     - Super Admin: Username: `superadmin`, Password: `superadmin`

3. Navigation Control:
   - `NavigationManager.cs` ensures seamless navigation between forms.
   Note:  (The NavigationManager class is responsible for managing the navigation between different forms in the application. 
          It provides a centralized way to handle form transitions, ensuring that the application remains organized and easy to maintain.
          This is to promotes clean code by reducing coupling between forms and standardizing navigation behavior, making the application 
          easier to extend and debug as the project grows.)



4. DBConnections Class:
   - Handles database connectivity using the Singleton pattern.
   - Verifies user credentials against the database using `ValidateLogin`.
